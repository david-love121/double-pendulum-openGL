# Feature Specification: Double Pendulum OpenGL Visualization

**Feature Branch**: `001-build-an-opengl`  
**Created**: September 6, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Build an openGL application with two main views. The first view will allow me to view a detailed animation of a lagrangian based double pendulum simulation. The animation should be well labelled, with the length of the pendulums being labeled L1 and L2. The theta values should also be labeled and you should draw an arc from the vertical axis to the pendulum's length. This first screen shows an individual example of a pendulum. Then on the second screen, there will be a large graph demostrating the sometimes chaotic behavior of double pendulums. The way you will do this is by assigning each dot in the graph to a particular setup of initial conditions, and then you will assign a color to the point based upon the characteristics of the double pendulum. This graph will show where there are localities of non-chaotic behavior."

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A physics researcher wants to explore double pendulum dynamics by first observing a detailed simulation of a single pendulum configuration, then analyzing the chaos patterns across multiple initial conditions to identify regions of stable vs. chaotic behavior.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the application is launched, **When** user opens the simulation view, **Then** they see an animated double pendulum with clearly labeled lengths (L1, L2) and angular positions (Œ∏1, Œ∏2) with visual arcs showing angles from vertical
2. **Given** a pendulum simulation is running, **When** user switches to the analysis view, **Then** they see a graph where each point represents different initial conditions and colors indicate behavioral characteristics
3. **Given** the analysis view is displayed, **When** user examines the color patterns, **Then** they can identify regions where pendulum behavior is non-chaotic (similar colors clustered together)
4. **Given** the user is viewing either screen, **When** they interact with the interface, **Then** the labels remain clearly visible and accurate throughout the animation

### Edge Cases
- What happens when pendulum parameters result in extremely fast motion?
- How does the system handle numerical instability in the physics simulation?
- How does the color mapping behave at the boundaries between chaotic and non-chaotic regions?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST display an animated double pendulum simulation using Lagrangian mechanics
- **FR-002**: System MUST label pendulum arm lengths as L1 and L2 with visible text
- **FR-003**: System MUST display angular positions Œ∏1 and Œ∏2 with visual arc indicators from vertical axis
- **FR-004**: System MUST provide two distinct viewing modes: detailed simulation and chaos analysis
- **FR-005**: System MUST generate a graph where each point represents unique initial conditions
- **FR-006**: System MUST assign colors to graph points based on pendulum behavioral characteristics
- **FR-007**: System MUST allow users to switch between the simulation view and analysis view
- **FR-008**: System MUST maintain real-time animation performance for smooth pendulum motion
- **FR-009**: System MUST visually distinguish between chaotic and non-chaotic behavior regions through color clustering
- **FR-010**: System MUST [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specify frame rate requirement for smooth animation]
- **FR-011**: System MUST [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: define the specific behavioral characteristics used for color mapping]
- **FR-012**: System MUST [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specify the resolution and range of initial conditions to sample]

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Pendulum Configuration**: Represents a double pendulum setup with arm lengths L1, L2, masses, and initial angular positions Œ∏1, Œ∏2
- **Simulation State**: Current position, velocity, and acceleration values for both pendulum arms at any time point
- **Chaos Analysis Point**: A data point in the analysis graph representing specific initial conditions and their associated behavioral classification
- **Behavioral Characteristics**: Metrics used to determine whether a pendulum configuration exhibits chaotic or stable behavior over time
